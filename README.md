# praqma-RD
Praqma research and development work issue tracker

This is an experiment to track research work in Praqma, and doing it in public.

Ideas:

* large areas of research could have their own repositories, like or chef research: https://github.com/Praqma/study-succotash
* if they don't have their own repo, it could be a milestone or label
* misc and simpler things, could to start with just be issue here and without any scope or context.


## Areas

* Docker: Subdirectory [/docker](/docker) have a separate [readme](/docker/README.md)
